## Finding New Problem
* Finding new problem in theory. One theory problem 
  can be deployed in many applications, such as domain adaptation.
  But even domain adaptation can be split into many subfields based
  on the applications, such as supervised domain adaptations and
  unsupervised domain adaptations.
* Finding new application.

## Finding New Methods

## How to have new ideas?
* **Assemble Problems** For example, image translation and multimodal generation,
  by assembling them together we can have *multimodal image translation*. Another
  example is we assemble image translation with domain adaptation.

* **Remove or Loose Assumptions** Methods or algorithms or applications are subjected
  to some assumptions, such as machine learning splits the dataset into
  training and testing data and assume that the distributions are same. But in
  many applications, the assumption is not satisfied. By removing the assumption,
  we arrive domain adaptation in which the distribution could be different between
  training and testing domains.
    
* **Creating New Methods From a Simpler Idea** Many machine learning algorithms
  are from very simpler intuitions. Starting from an intuition, design everything carefully, and then we can arrive to a good position.
