Image translation with shape changing

1) Unconditional

These algorithms hypothesis that input image and output image 

2) Conditional, conditions is based on applications, binary masks, attentions, landmarks and so on.

a) two steps, shape change and image translation, then combine the shape and translated image.

b) intergated, couples (shape and image) to couples (shape and image)
