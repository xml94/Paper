# Image to Image Multimodal

Multimodal image translation or generation aims to produce different
images as output from a single input, belonging to one-to-many mapping.
The outputs aligning to a same input image differs in style, such as
illumination, color, viewpoints.

The basic idea to do it is that some loss functions or mechanisms
should be used to push one-to-many mapping process.
